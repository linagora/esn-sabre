# OpenPaaS ESN Frontend for SabreDAV

Welcome to the OpenPaaS frontend for [SabreDAV](http://sabre.io/). This frontend adds calendaring and address book capabilities to your OpenPaaS instance and allows you to access them via standard CalDAV and CardDAV clients like Lightning.

## Setting up the Environment

Those are the steps needed on an [Ubuntu](http://ubuntu.com/) distribution, but the equivalent can be found for any Linux flavor.

### Install esn-sabre

```bash
cd /var/www/html
git clone https://ci.linagora.com/linagora/lgs/openpaas/esn-sabre.git
```

The OpenPaaS frontend is managed through [composer](https://getcomposer.org/), all requirements can easily be set up using:

```bash
cd esn-sabre
composer update
```

This command can be repeated to update package versions.
